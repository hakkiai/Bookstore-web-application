# Bookstore-web-application
A simple web application that allows users to add, view, and delete books from a database. Users can enter book details such as name, author, and publication year. The app is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js with Express for the backend. MongoDB is used for database storage, and RESTful APIs handle data interactions.
